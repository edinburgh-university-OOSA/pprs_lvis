# pprs\_lvis
Tools for the PPRS course on waveform lidar

## Outline
This is an introduction to the power of programming for handling large and novel data.



## Foundations
A rapid overview of the essential features of python needed to process lidar data.

### 01\_foundations.py
Shows the basic operation of python, including variables and printing.


### 02\_list\_arrays.py
Gives a brief introduction to storing and accessing large amounts of data in single variables, as a list or array.


### 03\_read\_file.py
Shows how to read data from a file and calculate basic statistics.


### 04\_plotting.py
Shows how to plot scatterplots, line graphs and histograms


### 05\_loops\_and\_functions.py
Introduces the use of functions to make reusable code, loops for performing repetitive operations and ifs for making within code decisions.


### 06\_objects.py
Introduces object classes for python. Objects are a way to combine different data variables and functions within a single variable, in order to help pass data around and perform operations on that data. This greatly eases the writing and maintaining of large, complex pieces of software.


## LVIS
A library of code to produce remote sensing products from NASA LVIS lidar data.
